## Iberlef
[Iberlef](https://sites.google.com/view/iberlef-2025) competition for Natural Language Processing systems in Spanish. This repository represents our participation in the task: [MentalRiskES](https://sites.google.com/view/mentalriskes2025/home?authuser=0).

> According to a recent report by the World Health Organization, there is 1 in every 8 people in the world suffering from a mental disorder. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the prevalence of anxiety and depression to more than 26% in just one year. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds. The organisation considers that early identification is a key effective intervention to prevent these problems.
> 
> Consequently, there is a growing interest in detecting and identifying mental disorders in social media streams. [...]
>
> For this third edition, we propose two novel tasks, the first subtask is about the detection of the gambling disorder and the second subtask consists of detecting of type of addiction.


## Tasks
### Binary classification: Gambling Disorder
> This is a binary classification task aimed at determining whether a user is at high risk (label = 1) or low risk (label = 0) of developing a gambling-related disorder based on their messages. The objective is to enable early detection and facilitate timely interventions. 

### Multiclass Classification: Type of Addiction Detection
> As all users are at risk (low or high), no matter the decision, for all of them the model should identify the specific type of addiction associated with the disorder..The available labels are Betting, Online Gaming, Trading, and Lootboxes.
